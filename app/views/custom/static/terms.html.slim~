It is important for Users to know that Neighbor.ly and any content contained within it or any service provided in connection with Neighbor.ly is provided "AS IS" with no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied. The User assumes complete responsibility and risk for your use of this site and all its site-related services.
      p 
        strong Posting a Campaign. 
        |Neighbor.ly may provide you the opportunity to post your Campaign on Neighbor.ly to showcase and share certain information about the Campaign and elicit feedback and financial contributions from Members. Your Campaign Posting is User Content (as defined below), and is subject to all the terms and conditions relating to User Content in this Agreement. It is a breach of this Agreement to post a false or misleading Campaign or to post false or misleading information in your Campaign Profile. Members who post Campaigns are sometimes referred to in this Agreement as "Content Creators."
      p 
        strong Campaign Fundraising. 
        |Neighbor.ly may provide you the opportunity to fundraise for your Campaign by soliciting financial contributions to support the Campaign from Members ("Contributions"). The rules governing fundraising for your Campaign (the "Fundraising Rules") are as follows:
      ol
        li The first step in launching a fundraising Campaign using the Service is to create a Campaign profile page and post a "Funding Request." To post a Funding Request, set your goal for the total Contributions you wish to raise during your current Campaign ("Campaign Goal") and the date by which you'd like to raise the funds ("Campaign Deadline") on your Campaign Profile page. The Campaign Deadline can be shortened but not extended. Note, if you reach your Campaign goal, you can post a new Campaign to launch a Campaign to fund any additional phase of your Campaign. The number of Campaigns you can create is unlimited.
        li You will be required to designate the legal entity to which funds will be directed (the "Campaign Entity"). By providing the name and mailing address of your Campaign Entity to Neighbor.ly, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the Campaign Entity with the authority to bind the Campaign Entity to the terms of this Agreement, that the Campaign Entity is the legal entity responsible for the Campaign and accountable for the use of any funds raised for it on Neighbor.ly, and that you accept this Agreement on the Campaign Entity's behalf.
        li You will be required to provide Neighbor.ly true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself and maintain and properly update the registration data to keep it true accurate, current, and complete.
        li Contributions are only processed if a Campaign reaches or exceeds the target amount during the life of a Campaign. In order to receive processed Contributions, your Campaign Entity must establish a mailing address or Funding Account at the time you post your Campaign, with the disbursement method or payment processor designated by Neighbor.ly.
        li All processed Contributions made to a Campaign will be directed to the Campaign Entity's Funding Account. All Contributions paid to a Campaign Entity will constitute "Campaign Funding". Neighbor.ly is not responsible for any error or omission in the name, mailing address, or Funding Account information you provide. 
        li When you reach your Campaign Deadline, your Funding Request will automatically close and no more Contributions will be accepted for your Campaign. You may make a new Funding Request at any time before or after the end of your last Funding Request closes. If you reach your Campaign Goal by your Campaign Deadline, the Campaign is considered "greenlit" (successful) and contributions will be processed by Neighbor.ly or a 3rd party processor. At such time, you are required to Certify in writing to Neighbor.ly that the subject of your campaign will be funded as stated in your Campaign Profile. Once verified, Campaign Funds will be disbursed from the Funding Account to the Campaign Entity's designated payout option. Options include receiving a direct deposit in the Campaign Entity's bank account or a check in the mail. Payment will be made within 60 business days of a successful, Certified Campaign.
        li You may offer rewards for Contributions, called "Perks", provided that the offering of such Perks is lawful under all applicable laws, including without limitation state and federal securities laws, and otherwise complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any Campaign Funding payments may be subject to verification of the identity of you and the Campaign Entity, the use of funds, and the timeline of the Campaign. The verification procedure may involve an interview and/or document review if deemed necessary and may vary from time to time in Neighbor.ly's sole discretion. You and the Campaign Entity agree that Campaign Funding may only be used as stated in the Campaign, and that Campaign Funding will not be used for any other purpose. You agree that if at any time while a Funding Request is open or within thirty (30) days of the close of a Funding Request, Neighbor.ly makes a good faith determination that the identity of you or the Campaign Entity or the timeline of the Campaign are not as identified in the Campaign Posting, or that the Campaign Funding has not been used solely on behalf of the Campaign, you agree to promptly refund the entire amount of Campaign Funding from such Funding Request to the Contributors. Neighbor.ly reserves the right to change the Fundraising Rules at any time upon notice to you. If you do not accept a change made to the Fundraising Rules, your sole remedy shall be to terminate your Campaign Posting.
      p You shall have full responsibility for applicable taxes for all Campaign Funding paid to you under this Agreement, and for compliance with all applicable labor and employment requirements with respect to your self-employment, sole proprietorship or other form of business organization, and with respect to your employees and contractors, including state worker's compensation insurance coverage requirements and any U.S. immigration visa requirements. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Neighbor.ly harmless from any liability for, or assessment of, any claims or penalties with respect to such withholding taxes, labor or employment requirements, including any liability for, or assessment of, withholding taxes imposed on Neighbor.ly by the relevant taxing authorities with respect to any Campaign Funding paid to you.
      p Neighbor.ly makes no guarantee regarding the number or amount of Contributions, or the amount of any Campaign Funding payment to be made to you or the Campaign Entity under this Agreement.
      h4 id="contributingtocampaigns" Contributing to Campaigns
      p Neighbor.ly may provide you the opportunity to make Contributions to Campaign Postings on the Service. You may contribute to any Campaign with an open Funding Request in any amount you choose. This includes campaigns where you are the Content Creator. You may contribute to as many Campaigns as you like.
      p It is solely your choice to contribute to a Campaign. You understand that making a Contribution to a Campaign does not give you any rights in or to that Campaign, including without limitation any ownership, control, or distribution rights, and that the Campaign Entity shall be free to solicit other funding for the Campaign, enter into contracts for the Campaign, allocate rights in or to the Campaign, and otherwise direct the Campaign in its sole discretion. You further understand that nothing in this Agreement or otherwise limits Neighbor.ly's right to enter into agreements or business relationships relating to Campaigns. Neighbor.ly does not guarantee that any Campaign's Campaign Goal will be met. Any Perks offered to you are between you and the Campaign Entity only, and Neighbor.ly does not guarantee that Rewards will be delivered or satisfactory to you. Neighbor.ly does not guarantee the use of any Campaign Funding for any purpose or the outcome of any Campaign.
      p Contributions to Campaigns are nonrefundable. Under certain circumstances Neighbor.ly may, but is under no obligation to, seek the refund of Campaign Funding if the Campaign Entity misrepresents the Campaign or misuses the funds. You acknowledge and agree that all your Contributions are between you, the Campaign Entity, and the Processor only, and that Neighbor.ly is not responsible for Contribution transactions, including without limitation any personal or payment information you provide to the Processor (Authorize.net or other processors hired by Neighbor.ly).
      p Neighbor.ly makes no promises, verifications, or guarantees regarding the deductibility of any Contribution for tax purposes. Neighbor.ly does not and will not offer or provide tax advice. Please consult your tax advisor for more information.
      p Contributors agree to pay any and all fees associated with such processing, as a surcharge to the Contribution Amount they select during the checkout process.
      p Neighbor.ly utilizes multiple payment processors in order to provide options for transactions to Contributors. Neighbor.ly uses <a href="http://www.authorize.net/">Authorize.net</a>as its direct credit card, debit card, and e-check payment processor. Sending or receiving payments for direct credit card transactions made with or through Neighbor.ly is subject to Authorize's <a href="http://www.authorize.net/company/terms/">Terms of Service</a>, Site Terms, and Acceptable Use Policy. By using these services, you agree to these additional terms.

        li resolving disputes,
